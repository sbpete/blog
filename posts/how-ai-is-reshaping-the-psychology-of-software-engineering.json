  "contentMarkdown": "# How AI is Reshaping the Psychology of Software Engineering\n\nAs AI increasingly takes over lower-level tasks in roles like software engineering and consulting, are our minds prepared for this dramatic shift toward higher-level thinking?\n\nAs a student entering the software industry, it is hard to deny that the role of the software engineer is evolving. AI is fundamentally reshaping how I approach both personal projects and daily technical work. Through these small projects, I have had the chance to iterate quickly and gain a wide range of experience using emerging AI tools.\n\nAs models become more capable at niche tasks like writing configuration files or debugging complex React rendering issues, it is harder to justify learning any specific language or framework in depth. Instead, my thinking naturally shifts toward higher-level reasoning, where I orchestrate the various pieces of a project rather than meticulously crafting each line of code. This skill set differs greatly from the day-to-day job of a traditional software engineer, yet I believe it will soon align with what companies expect.\n\nMany companies have already cut back on hiring entry-level talent. Those that screen for and cultivate higher-level reasoning skills will likely be the first to succeed in this new technical environment. One could argue that I am only experimenting with AI on small personal projects, and that it will be years before these tools can produce industry-level code. But given the rapid leaps in model performance and the massive investments from AI firms, I believe it is only a few years before AI contributes to 50% or more of the new code written across the industry.\n\n---\n\n## From Syntax to Systems Thinking\n\nMany developers today still rely on lower-level, inductive thinking, deciding on minor code changes based on syntax rules or past experience with a language. Unfortunately, that is precisely the kind of work that large language models excel at.\n\nDevelopers should instead look to their team leads, architects, or even other areas of the business to learn how to make decisions that not only solve the immediate problem but also serve the entire codebase and organization. Learning to effectively integrate AI tools can make developers faster, improve code reliability, and free up time to focus on areas where they can add true value.\n\n---\n\n## A Shift Toward Leadership and Ownership\n\nAt first, this shift may sound like it will shrink job opportunities. After all, if everyone needs to become a higher-level thinker, what happens to the entry-level roles? But in reality, leadership positions are becoming more common in the AI era.\n\nCompanies should be using this newly freed-up time to **experiment**, **innovate**, and **empower individual employees** to lead their own initiatives with an army of AI collaborators. The ability to iterate rapidly and experiment boldly will define success in the coming decade, where a maximalist approach that embraces AI as an extension of human capability will be essential.\n"
