All three still have value, but none of them scale well to how fast technology now moves or how uneven prior knowledge usually is.\n\nDocumentation is authoritative, but it is written to be complete, not pedagogical. It assumes patience, context, and motivation that most learners simply do not have at every moment. Courses and video lectures have the opposite problem. They are too linear. They move at one speed, in one order, for one imaginary learner who is never you.\n\nWhat you are reacting to is real. These methods optimize for content delivery, not understanding.\n\n---\n\n## The Deeper Problem With Modern Learning\n\nThe core issue is not access to information. It is feedback.\n\nHistorically, the most effective learning model was mentorship. An apprentice learned by doing real work, sitting next to someone more experienced, getting corrected in real time, and being pushed just beyond their comfort zone. This model worked because feedback was constant, contextual, and personalized.\n\nWe drifted away from this model because mentorship does not scale. Courses do.\n\n---\n\n## AI as a Return to Apprenticeship, Not a Shortcut\n\nUsed poorly, AI produces what everyone now recognizes as AI slop: large amounts of output with shallow understanding. Used correctly, it recreates the best parts of the mentor model.\n\nAI is uniquely good at:\n- Adapting explanations to your current mental model  \n- Answering questions out of order  \n- Reviewing your code and pointing out conceptual gaps  \n\nWhat it lacks is intent and taste. It does not know what matters unless you tell it. This is where humans stay in the loop.\n\nWhen learning a new programming language, the context already exists. Language documentation, design proposals, and statements from the language authors are distilled expressions of intent. Feeding this material to the model as grounding constraints dramatically improves the quality of guidance you get.\n\nInstead of reading the docs linearly, you turn them into rules the AI must respect.\n\n---\n\n## Why Understanding Must Grow With Output\n\nThere is a real risk in learning with AI: moving too fast.\n\nA common failure mode looks like this. A developer spins up a side project in a new language. The AI writes most of the code. Features pile up. Then something breaks, and debugging becomes painful or impossible because the developer does not actually understand the language’s execution model or design philosophy.\n\nThe project runs away from its creator.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of leverage. Output increased. Understanding did not.\n\nThe goal is not to avoid AI. The goal is to force understanding to keep pace with output. That requires intentional friction.\n\n---\n\n## A Practical System for Learning a New Language in 2026\n\nThis is a concrete, repeatable approach you can apply to any modern language.\n\n### 1. Start With Intent, Not Syntax\nRead the language’s design goals and philosophy first. Understand what the language optimizes for: simplicity, explicitness, performance, safety, concurrency, or developer ergonomics. Summarize these principles and give them to the AI as rules it must follow.\n\n### 2. Job Shadowing\nPick something small but nontrivial: a CLI tool, a simple web service, or an example from the official docs. Have the AI walk you through its creation step by step, explaining not just what is happening, but why the language encourages this structure.\n\n### 3. Try It Yourself\nRebuild the same thing on your own, even if the result is messy. Then ask the AI to critique, refactor, and explain tradeoffs. This preserves ownership of your mental model.\n\n### 4. Force Explanations Before Fixes\nWhen something breaks, ask the AI to explain what is happening before proposing a solution. If you cannot restate the explanation in your own words, you are moving too fast.\n\n### 5. Continuously Extract Principles\nAfter each session, write down one or two rules you learned about the language. Not syntax. Behavior. For example, how error handling shapes control flow, or how concurrency primitives encourage certain designs.\n\n### 6. Periodically Remove the AI\nReimplement a component or solve a problem without assistance. This is how you detect the illusion of competence early.\n\n### 7. Revisit the Documentation With Context\nDocumentation is most valuable after you have struggled. Return to it when you have concrete questions. You will read it differently the second time.\n\n---\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nTechnology accelerates the spread of information. That forces us to evolve how we learn.\n\nThe winning strategy is not passive consumption or blind automation. It is active apprenticeship at machine speed.\n\nAI does not replace understanding. It amplifies whatever learning system you bring to it. If that system is shallow, the output will be shallow. If it is deliberate, AI becomes the most powerful learning multiplier we have ever had.\n\nUsed correctly, learning a new programming language in 2026 is not about finishing tutorials. It is about building judgment and familiarity as efficiently as possible.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n- *Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years* — Peter Norvig - https://norvig.com/21-days.html \n- *Why You Need Multiple Mentors* - Harvard Business Review - https://hbr.org/2021/06/why-you-need-multiple-mentors"
