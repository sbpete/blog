From automated testing and continuous integration to the cloud infrastructure revolution, progress in our field has consistently been about freeing engineers from repetitive labor so they can focus on higher-order problems.\n\nAs the article *How to Build Good Software* notes:  \n> “You cannot make technological progress if all your time is spent on rebuilding existing technology.”  \n\nThis mindset is exactly what drives innovation, but it also raises a critical question in the age of AI: **If AI can now perform many of the same functions as software developers, where does that leave the human engineer?**\n\nWhile it’s tempting to think that AI might automate the role entirely, the reality is more nuanced. The most valuable aspects of software development have never been the lines of code themselves, but the systems, decisions, and empathy surrounding their creation. Rapid iteration, meaningful stakeholder feedback, and engineers who make thoughtful trade-offs between business goals and technical integrity remain the lifeblood of successful projects.  \n\nAt its core, software engineering is about solving human problems,reducing friction in daily life, enabling new possibilities, and sometimes even revealing pain points that users didn’t know they had. AI, despite being trained on vast amounts of human data and capable of mimicking empathy, still struggles to truly understand or prioritize human pain. It lacks the lived experience and intuition to notice when frustration has become normalized or when a process could be reimagined entirely.  \n\nAs Henry Ford famously put it:  \n> “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”  \n\nTrue innovation doesn’t come from asking users what they want, it comes from observing where they struggle and understanding why. This is why the most successful software products are often born from founders who obsess over user experience and spend time shadowing their users to uncover hidden sources of pain.\n\nA great example of this is Airbnb. Before launching, Brian Chesky didn’t rely solely on surveys or data, they personally stayed with hosts, took photos of listings themselves, and spoke directly with guests to understand every point of friction. They learned that trust and presentation mattered more than anything else, which led to design choices like verified profiles, reviews, and high-quality photos. This extreme attention to detail and firsthand empathy transformed Airbnb from a niche idea into a global platform that redefined travel.\n\nAI may help us move faster, but it cannot yet feel the frustration of a clunky interface, the anxiety of a failed payment, or the relief of a problem solved elegantly. Those sensations, those insights come from humans themselves.\n\nIn the end, progress in software isn’t just about automation, it’s about empathy. The tools we build, whether powered by AI or not, must always circle back to one fundamental question: *What pain are we solving for the user?*\n\n---\n\n## References\n\nShanmugaratnam, T.
