It’s no longer enough to just apply for jobs, and even referrals are far from guarantees. Yet many students keep focusing on coding problems and interview prep, essentially polishing steps two, three, and four without realizing they haven’t even reached step one.\n\nThe truth is, most of the work that determines whether you’ll get an interview happens before the interview stage. Once you’re there, success depends more on showing genuine interest, a good attitude, and solid fundamentals like problem-solving. But you can’t showcase those if you never get the chance to sit down with someone.\n\nIn practice, students should focus more on building their networks, especially with people already in the industry, not just classmates. This can happen through clubs, conferences, or simple outreach. Message people on LinkedIn. Ask thoughtful questions. Use any existing connections. Be genuine.\n\nIt’s easy to let ego get in the way and believe you should land a job on merit alone, but that’s not how things work right now. Networking isn’t about begging for favors. It’s about being someone others want to help or work with. Small talk during networking calls can reveal your personality and make the conversation more natural. Always end by asking if there’s anyone else they’d recommend you speak with. One connection is rarely enough, especially at large companies.\n\nUnderstand that some companies are hiring very little and tend to prioritize internal or senior referrals. Don’t take that personally. Instead, use each conversation to learn more about demand, company culture, and team priorities. Keep your expectations grounded but your curiosity high.\n\nEven if it’s a numbers game, don’t approach networking aimlessly. Go in with intent. Research the company beforehand, reference specific projects or initiatives, and connect them to your own interests or skills. Show that you’ve put in effort. That small signal of preparation often matters more than the perfect resume.\n\nIt’s easy to be pessimistic, but engineers, like anyone else, need to understand how to bring real value to companies. The sooner you focus on that, the sooner you’ll move from sending applications into the void to having actual conversations that matter."
