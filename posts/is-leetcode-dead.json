Big Tech needed a standardized filter for massive applicant pools, and algorithmic problem-solving became that filter. That era is shifting, but it remains one of the clearest and most universal signals of technical ability.\n\n\n## Why LeetCode Still Matters\n\nEven with AI, companies can’t simply drop structured coding challenges. They need a way to compare thousands of candidates efficiently, and LeetCode-style assessments still do that better than any alternative. You don't see ACT/SAT style questions in college or the real world, but it remains a healthy part of the college application process. Ideally, you have a way to fully see how a candidate works and test the extent of their knowledge, but practically an simpler measure is needed to filter applicants on a large scale.\n\nConsider:\n\n- Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Bloomberg, and Uber still rely heavily on LeetCode-style interviews.\n- interviewing.io data shows that more than 70 percent of top-tier tech companies continue using algorithmic interviews as their primary early-round filter.\n- Blind and Levels.fyi discussions consistently confirm that the highest-paying roles still emphasize data structures and algorithms.\n- Companies adopting AI-assisted platforms like CodeSignal, Karat, or HackerRank still test the same core problem types.\n\nLarge companies move slowly. Their hiring processes are built to be repeatable, scalable, and fair across tens of thousands of applicants. These systems don’t get rewritten overnight because ChatGPT exists.\n\nThe irony is that AI raises the bar rather than lowering it. If everyone uses AI to “learn,” the interview becomes the only moment where companies can isolate your own reasoning. That makes real problem-solving skill, not memorized patterns, more important than before.\n\n## Why LeetCode Alone Isn’t Enough\n\nWhat’s changed is the weight it carries. LeetCode is no longer the whole game; it’s just one piece.\n\nYou also need:\n- projects that demonstrate real-world engineering,\n- a network that gets your foot in the door,\n- clean and reliable code,\n- higher-level understanding beyond algorithm drills.\n\nAI is pushing engineering toward architecture, debugging, and reasoning about systems. Those skills now matter as much as raw algorithm knowledge.\n\n## What’s Emerging Alongside LeetCode\n\nCompanies are slowly diversifying their assessments:\n\n- Debugging-focused questions, especially at mid-size companies.\n- “Learn this API from scratch” exercises for practical or forward-deployed roles.\n- AI-assisted interviews under experimentation at places like LinkedIn.\n- Take-homes for early-stage companies with smaller applicant pools.\n\n## The Next Decade\n\nLeetCode is shifting from memorization to fluency. Top companies will keep using it because it’s still the only objective benchmark that scales across millions of applicants.\n\nIn a world where:\n- AI automates boilerplate,\n- fundamentals separate capable engineers from prompt-dependent ones,\n- companies need evidence of your own thinking,\n\n\nYou don’t need to grind for hours a day. But being comfortable with algorithms remains one of the most reliable career unlocks in tech. Ignoring it because \"AI can do the same thing\" or you \"won't need it at your job\" is an easy way to take yourself out of the running."
