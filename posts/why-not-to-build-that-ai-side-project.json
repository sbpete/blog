  "contentMarkdown": "It feels like everyone on the internet is building a new AI project: another “life automation” app, a personalized workout planner, or another AI to-do-list app. The barrier to entry is pretty much gone. With a few prompts, you can vibe code your way to something that kind of works. With all the hype, it's easy to overlook the essential question that should always be asked when starting a project like this: *should this thing really exist?*\n\n## The Trap of Constant Creation\n\nThere is a quiet pressure in tech right now to always be building something new. If you are not shipping projects every month, it can feel like you are falling behind. But not every idea deserves to become an app, and most probably should not\n\nThe truth is, someone has likely already made a better version of what you are thinking about. Or your project is just a small feature that would make more sense as part of a bigger ecosystem. Even if it does not exist today, chances are it will in the near future. I learned this firsthand when a feature I built, daily prompt scheduling, was added to Perplexity just a few weeks later. In other words, novelty does not necessarily equal value when things move so fast.\n\n## When AI Becomes a Shortcut Too Far\n\nAI has lowered the technical barrier to creation, but it has also made it dangerously easy to skip the learning part of engineering. Reading AI outputs is not a substitute for real practice. Without depth, you do not build durable skills, and you do not get better at problem-solving; you just get better at prompting.\n\nYes, you can vibe code an app that “works.” But when something breaks (and it will), debugging becomes a nightmare because you do not actually understand what the AI built. What was meant to save time often ends up wasting it. Shiny output, brittle foundation.\n\nIf you plotted it out, you would see the pattern: perceived usefulness skyrockets early, then flattens, while real usefulness grows slowly but consistently until it surpasses the illusion.\n\n![Perceived vs Real Usefulness](https://quickchart.io/chart?bkg=white&c={type:'line',data:{labels:['Idea','Prototype','Launch','Month-1','Month-6'],datasets:[{label:'Perceived-Usefulness',data:[0,80,100,90,60],borderColor:'#FF7F50',fill:false},{label:'Real Usefulness',data:[0,10,30,60,90],borderColor:'#4682B4',fill:false}]},options:{title:{display:true,text:'The Reality Gap: Perceived vs Real Usefulness'}}}) \n\n## Building With Intention\n\nThere are still great reasons to build (and I do it quite frequently) as long as you are doing it for the right ones:\n\n- It is genuinely useful.\n- There is nothing quite like it, or existing options are too limited or costly.\n- The idea truly benefits from using AI or automation.\n- You want to deepen your technical skills through hands-on work.\n- You find joy in creating and view it as a form of artistic expression.\n\nI have built tools like a syllabus-to-Google Sheets converter, a weekly agent that updates my workout plan, a blog post uploader, and a networking tracker. Each existed to solve a real pain point, not just to exist.\n\n## The Simpler, Smarter Way Forward\n\nIt is easy to get caught up in how effortless building has become. But real productivity comes from simplicity and intentionality. Just because you can build something does not always mean you should, or that building it is the best use of your time.\n\nSo instead of rushing to spin up another AI app, maybe start with a simpler question: *is there already something out there that does this well enough?*\n\nIf the answer is yes, do not buy, do not build. Maybe just find something free?\n"
