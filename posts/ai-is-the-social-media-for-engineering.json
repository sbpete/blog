Much of it is genuinely insightful. That is the trap.\n\nInput does not equal learning.\n\nLearning requires friction. It requires sitting with an idea long enough to integrate it into your existing mental models. It requires trying, failing, and correcting. Most people skip that part. Instead, they consume the next thing.\n\nCognitive science backs this up. Research on attention and learning shows that passive consumption leads to shallow processing and poor long-term retention, especially when information arrives rapidly and without effortful recall.\n\nAn analogy helps here.\n\nReading a recipe does not mean you know how to cook the dish.\n\nYou only learn once you try to make it in your own kitchen, with your own tools, and fix what goes wrong. Most people are just reading recipes all day and wondering why they never improve.\n\n---\n\n## Dopamine, Feeds, and Fragmented Attention\n\nShort-form content makes this worse.\n\nYouTube contains some of the most educational material ever created. Yet ask yourself a blunt question: can you name one concrete thing you learned from the last video you watched?\n\nSocial media is even more extreme. It is optimized for dopamine, not understanding. Fast context switching fragments attention, and fragmented attention kills deep learning.\n\nStudies consistently show that frequent task switching and digital distraction reduce comprehension, working memory capacity, and the ability to sustain focus.\n\nNow layer AI on top of this.\n\nAI is an incredible tool for engineering and learning. It can speed up feedback loops, expose blind spots, and help you reason through complex problems. Used well, it is a multiplier.\n\nUsed poorly, it becomes social media for engineers.\n\nEndless, polished, agreeable responses. Suggestions that nudge you to ask just one more question. Branching ideas that split your attention. Code that works but is poorly suited to your actual problem. Explanations that feel satisfying but never force you to think.\n\nThe danger is subtle. With social media, we know we are wasting time. With AI, it feels productive. You think you are learning or engineering, when in reality you are skimming solutions you do not understand.\n\nIf you are not actively counteracting this, AI will happily give you:\n\n- Code you cannot explain  \n- Designs you did not reason through  \n- Answers that sound good but are not optimal  \n- A false sense of competence  \n\nThat is how engineers get worse, not better.\n\n---\n\n## Treat AI Like a Tool, Not a Feed\n\nThe fix is not to avoid AI. It is to change how you use it.\n\nAI is only as good as the structure you impose on it.\n\n### 1. Change the Instructions\n\nDefault AI behavior is optimized for engagement and politeness. Override it.\n\nTell it to be direct. Tell it to challenge you. Tell it to reason from first principles. Remove the social lubricant.\n\nIf you do not do this, you will get generic, pleasing output by default.\n\n### 2. Separate Learning From Execution\n\nIf you are learning:\n\n- Tell the model to ask you questions  \n- Use Socratic reasoning  \n- Have it quiz you  \n- Force yourself to answer before seeing solutions  \n\nDo not rob yourself of the learning loop. Struggle is part of the process.\n\nIf you are engineering:\n\n- Provide a clear outline  \n- Be explicit about constraints  \n- Share what you have already tried  \n- Ask it to identify tradeoffs, not just solutions  \n\nVagueness produces slop.\n\n### 3. Slow the Interaction Down\n\nRapid prompting feels productive but fractures attention.\n\nPause. Read the response carefully. Summarize it in your own words. Modify it. Test it. Break it. Fix it.\n\nThis is the equivalent of cooking the recipe instead of bookmarking it.\n\n### 4. Do Some Work Without AI\n\nThis matters more than people want to admit.\n\nIf you never reason through problems on your own, your internal models atrophy. AI should extend your thinking, not replace it.\n\nThe more you understand the problem space, the better AI performs. High-quality input produces high-quality output. Shallow understanding produces homogeneous junk.\n\n---\n\n## Closing: Engineering Still Requires Depth\n\nAI does not make engineers better by default.\n\nUsed lazily, it does the same thing YouTube does to learning. It creates the illusion of progress while eroding focus and understanding.\n\nUsed deliberately, it is one of the most powerful tools we have ever had.\n\nThe difference is discipline.\n\nSoftware engineering has always rewarded deep work, clear thinking, and the ability to reason through complexity. AI does not change that. It amplifies it, for better or worse.\n\nTreat AI like social media, and it will make you dumber.  \nTreat it like a tool, and it will make you dangerous.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- Bjork, Dunlosky, Kornell. *Desirable Difficulties in Learning*  \n- Ophir, Nass, Wagner. *Cognitive Control in Media Multitaskers*  \n- Rosen et al. *Media Multitasking and Cognitive Control*  \n- Ward et al. *Brain Drain: The Mere Presence of Smartphones*"
