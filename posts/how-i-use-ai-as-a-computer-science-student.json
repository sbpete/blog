It is a practical tool that sits inside almost every part of how I work, learn, and build. Below are five AI tools I use regularly, each serving a different purpose in my workflow.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Wispr Flow\n\nI use Wispr Flow when I want to speak or write rough thoughts into my computer. It handles messy inputs well, even though my inputs are usually still fairly refined. I could probably push it further and use it for more polished writing instead of treating it only as a scratchpad.\n\n### 2. ChatGPT\n\nThis is my main tool for general-purpose tasks and long-term projects. It works best when I repeat tasks, need long-form context, or want consistent instructions across sessions. I customize ChatGPT to be more critical of me and to think from first principles so I don’t end up with overly optimistic answers.\n\n### 3. Perplexity’s Comet Browser\n\nI treat Comet as an early bet on the future of AI-driven web automation. It can pick up a task midway and continue it, which is valuable for routine online workflows. Right now it is not essential, but it will get better as models improve and as I learn more ways to use it.\n\n### 4. Notebook LM\n\nFor exams and assessments, quizzing myself works better than rereading notes. Notebook LM gives me audio previews and then practice questions with clear explanations. I tried ChatGPT’s study mode, but Notebook LM is built entirely for this use case, so I usually default to it.\n\n### 5. Cursor\n\nCursor is excellent for spinning up websites and standard project structures. It struggles when the problem gets too complex or when the codebase grows beyond what you can personally track. Models tend to add complexity by default, so you have to fight that bias and keep the code simple, readable, and maintainable. If a project is high-stakes and genuinely requires complex architecture, that is usually a sign you should not let AI handle the core logic.\nThe Windows Vista launch is an example of complexity causing real-world pain. It promised major improvements, but performance issues, hardware incompatibilities, and a messy release cycle created one of Microsoft’s most criticized operating system launches.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAI does not replace the fundamentals of computer science. It amplifies them by giving me more time to think clearly, learn faster, and build more. The key is staying critical, keeping things simple, and using AI as a tool rather than a crutch.\n\n---\n\n### Source\n\nTech Time Travel: The Troubled Launch of Windows Vista, The National CIO Review  \nhttps://nationalcioreview.com/articles-insights/tech-time-travel/tech-time-travel-the-troubled-launch-of-windows-vista/\n"
