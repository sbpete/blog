Whether you're just starting to use AI or it is already part of your daily work, I hope this helps you think about how it is really changing things. AI promises to speed everything up, from writing code to generating reports to automating workflows. But how useful it actually is depends on how people use it. Some people get huge productivity boosts. Others get frustrated or even slower. A recent [ACM study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3643795.3648379) found that trust, experience, and understanding play a big role in how effective AI really is. The more you know its limits, the more you get out of it. ## The New Stress of “Speed” Software development has always been full of estimates. How long until it is done? How much effort will it take? Now, new tools claim to make everything faster. Product managers expect quicker delivery. Executives expect more output. Engineers are left trying to keep up. The result is less testing, fewer reviews, and more chaos. Code gets shipped that is not ready. Tech stacks change weekly. Managers are stressed about picking the right tools and developers are burned out trying to hit unrealistic goals. AI was supposed to make things easier, but often it just shifts the pressure somewhere else. It is not that AI is bad. It is that expectations grow faster than what is realistic. Everyone wants instant results. But real software still takes time to test, integrate, and maintain. ## When Engineers Stop Learning If every time something breaks we ask AI to fix it, we stop learning how to debug and think critically. Debugging is how you build intuition. You learn how systems connect and where assumptions fail. That skill fades fast if you let AI think for you. The scary part is that AI code looks correct. It compiles, it runs, and it may even pass your tests. But it might be subtly wrong in ways that are hard to spot. When you do not understand what it is doing, you cannot fix it later. AI cannot replace problem solving. It can only hide it behind convenience. The best developers will still be the ones who know how to think, not just how to prompt. ## Losing Sight of Business Value A lot of AI projects sound impressive but have little real purpose. Companies love to show off “AI-powered” features that do not actually help users. It is easy to confuse building something with building something valuable. As engineers, our job is not to write code. It is to create value, something people use, enjoy, or pay for. If AI does not help with that, it is just noise. Only humans can connect technology to real needs. AI does not understand business trade-offs, users, or context. Without that judgment, teams can waste months chasing trends that do not matter. ## The Culture Gap AI has made it even harder for engineers, managers, and executives to stay aligned. Leadership hears “AI writes code instantly” and assumes timelines should shrink. Engineers know that even if AI writes code, it does not design, test, or deploy it. That misunderstanding creates tension. Developers feel rushed. Managers feel behind. Executives wonder why things still take time. The fix is not more AI. The fix is clearer communication about what AI can and cannot do. ## Using AI the Right Way Ethan Mollick’s [Co-Intelligence](https://www.co-intelligence.com/) describes two ways to work with AI: the centaur and the cyborg. The centaur model works better. Humans stay in control and use AI as support. AI handles speed and repetition while humans handle judgment and direction. To make that work, the fundamentals of engineering still matter: **Testing:** Define what correct means. **Modularity:** Keep systems clean and understandable. **Code reviews:** Humans catch what AI cannot. **Documentation:** Do not rely on AI to explain everything later. These basics have always mattered. AI does not change that. If anything, it makes them more important. ## The Real Role of AI AI will not take entire jobs. It will take the boring parts of them. That is a good thing if you use it correctly. The best engineers will use AI as leverage, not a crutch. AI gives us a chance to focus on what actually matters: building useful things, solving real problems, and thinking deeply about how tech fits into the world. The danger is not that AI replaces us. The danger is that we stop thinking critically because it is easier not to. ## Further Reading [Things They Did Not Teach You About Software Engineering](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/things-they-didnt-teach-you/) [ACM Study on LLM Perception and Usefulness](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3643795.3648379) *Co-Intelligence* by Ethan Mollick AI will not destroy software engineering, but it will make it obvious who truly understands it."
