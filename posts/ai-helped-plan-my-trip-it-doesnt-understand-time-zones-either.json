  "contentMarkdown": "## The Setup\n\nI decided to lean into AI to plan an international trip from start to finish. Not just asking for ideas, but actually treating it like a planning partner.\n\nI used ChatGPT heavily. I set up a project, dumped in the most complete version of my itinerary, and had it format everything inside the canvas. I used Perplexity to search the web for up-to-date info. Then I compared what AI suggested with real booking platforms like Airbnb.\n\nThe goal was simple. Could AI meaningfully reduce planning effort without sacrificing quality?\n\nThe answer is yes, but with lots of limitations.\n\n---\n\n## Where AI Started to Fall Short\n\nI immediately I noticed a few issues.\n\nAI leaned hard into logistics. Trains, transfers, check-ins, check-outs. The plans were aggressive, bordering on optimistic. Tight transfers. Long travel days. Minimal slack because it was trying to fit in everything I told it.\n\nAt the same time, it was strangely lax about the day-to-day reality. Weather. How tired you might be. The fact that standing in line for an hour can ruin an afternoon. These things only showed up when I explicitly prompted for them. It emphasized doing everything I told it to do rather than making the plan realistic for an actual human to pull off, which is to be expected from models that are built to please rather than empathize.\n\nIn addition to the human aspects, it also struggled to reason about arrival dates, day rollovers, and return timing. It confidently produced plans that mixed up time zones and had me arriving a day later than I should have. Time zones seem to be a weak point for AI models too.\n\n---\n\n## AI vs Human Judgment\n\nAI is excellent at breadth. It gives you options, patterns, and structure. It surfaces things you did not know to search for. It can rough out a ten-day plan in minutes.\n\nHumans are better at friction.\n\nA human planner instinctively asks:\n\n- What happens if this train is late?\n- Will I actually want to do this after flying for twelve hours?\n- Is this neighborhood dead at night?\n- Is this a “must see” or just a “nice on Instagram”?\n\nAI does not feel inconvenience. It does not feel cold rain, crowded stations, or decision fatigue. Unless you explicitly encode those concerns, they do not exist.\n\n---\n\n## What AI Is Actually Good At\n\nOnce I adjusted expectations, AI became genuinely useful.\n\nHere is where it shines:\n\n- **Broad strokes planning**  \n  Cities, sequencing, and high-level pacing. It is great at answering “what makes sense together.”\n\n- **Constraint-based iteration**  \n  Telling it things like “avoid lines,” “minimize transfers,” or “stay under X budget” meaningfully improved results.\n\n- **Rough budgeting**  \n  Not precise, but directionally helpful. It quickly exposed which parts of the trip were driving cost.\n\n- **Formatting and organization**  \n  Turning chaos into a clean itinerary, tables, and checklists is one of its strongest skills. I even made a super-polished powerpoint with Nano Banana.\n\n- **Getting better with detail**  \n  The more context I gave it, the better it performed. Vague prompts produce generic plans. Specific constraints produce surprisingly thoughtful ones.\n\nBut it never replaced due diligence. I still checked accommodations manually, and Airbnb still had the best deals over perplexity's fast but incomplete search. I still verified routes, bookings, and timing myself and expect that humans will have to do this for a while.\n\n---\n\n## The Prompts That Actually Worked\n\nA few things made a noticeable difference:\n\n- Creating a dedicated project and pasting in the entire plan, not fragments\n- Explicitly stating preferences like avoiding lines or over-packed days\n- Asking for options, not a single “best” plan\n- Requesting rough budgets early to anchor decisions\n- Treating outputs as drafts, not answers\n\n---\n\n## So What Is the Real Limitation?\n\nAfter using it end-to-end, I am not convinced this is purely a technology problem.\n\nThe building blocks are there. Context windows are larger. Reasoning is better. Tooling is improving.\n\nWhat is missing is lived experience and implicit judgment. And that might not be solvable with prompts alone.\n\nWhich raises the real question.\n\nIs AI not ready to be a travel agent yet?\n\nOr are we still learning how to be good users of it?\n"
